## Steps
- 1.) Decide on a Data Structure
    - Input size array of different difficulty (min: 10 --> max: 20)

- 2.)  Bombs
    - location: randomized
    - Amount: bomb_amount = input^2 / 8 - 10;
    - If bomb is placed on a square that already has a value, simply replace it with the bomb

- 3.) Numbers
    - Around each bomb the squares should be incremented by 1(8 boxes)
    - If it is 0, then it is empty and should not display 0
